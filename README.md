# **Pandas Provenance Tracker**

## **Overview**
The **Pandas Provenance Tracker** is a Python library designed to integrate provenance tracking into the pandas framework. This tool ensures transparency and reproducibility in data science by capturing metadata about the transformations performed on data during analysis. By logging key operations and their effects on the data, this project makes it easier to trace data lineage, verify data workflows, and reproduce results.

## **Features**
- **Automatic Provenance Logging**: Captures metadata (e.g., operation type, timestamp) for pandas operations like `filter()`, `merge()`, and `groupby()`.
- **Tuple-Level Granularity**: Tracks data changes at the row level to ensure precise provenance.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly with pandas, extending its functions to include provenance tracking.
- **Efficient Log Storage**: Provenance logs are saved in structured formats like JSON for easy inspection and sharing.
- **Reproducibility and Accountability**: Helps researchers and teams reproduce results and understand how data has been processed.

## **Installation**

To install **Pandas Provenance Tracker**, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   If you'd like to use a virtual environment to isolate the projectâ€™s dependencies, you can create one as follows:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv


Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
You can generate the requirements.txt file by running:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Requirements
To run the Pandas Provenance Tracker, you will need the following libraries:

pandas
(list any other dependencies you are using)
To install them, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing the dependencies and setting up your environment, you can start using the tool. Here's a sample usage:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from pandas_provenance_tracker import filter_with_provenance

# Load a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'B': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
})

# Filter data with provenance tracking
filtered_df = filter_with_provenance(df, 'A', lambda x: x > 2)

print(filtered_df)
The filter_with_provenance function logs the operation and keeps track of which rows are affected, along with a timestamp and operation description.

System Architecture
The Pandas Provenance Tracker operates by wrapping pandas operations and logging metadata in real-time. The system is composed of:

Data Operations Module: Handles pandas operations such as filtering and merging.
Provenance Logger: Logs the metadata for each operation performed.
Log Storage: Stores provenance information in structured formats (JSON).
Example Workflow:
A pandas operation (like merge()) is executed.
The provenance tracker logs the operation details.
The metadata is saved, and the transformed data is returned.
Applications
Research: Track and reproduce data transformations for research transparency.
Data Auditing: Enable easy verification of data transformations in regulated industries.
Collaboration: Facilitate collaboration by providing a clear record of how data has been manipulated.
Challenges
Performance: Handling large datasets efficiently while logging every transformation.
Tuple-Level Granularity: Ensuring every row's change is captured without significantly impacting performance.

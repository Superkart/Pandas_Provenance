# Pandas Provenance Tracker

## Description
This project implements manual provenance tracking for data transformations in the pandas library. It provides functions to log details of various data operations, such as filtering, aggregation, and joins, allowing users to trace the evolution of their data through each step of analysis. This provenance tracking helps ensure transparency, reproducibility, and accountability in data workflows, particularly in complex data science and machine learning projects.

## Key Features
- **Provenance Logs**: Automatically captures metadata for each data manipulation, including timestamps, descriptions of actions, and summaries of input/output data.
- **Wrapper Functions for Pandas**: Functions like `filter_with_provenance` and others are designed to seamlessly wrap around standard pandas operations, tracking provenance without changing workflows.
- **JSON Provenance Log**: Logs are saved in a JSON file, making it easy to read, analyze, and share information about data transformations.

## Use Cases
- **Data Provenance in Research**: Ensures each step of data processing is traceable, making it suitable for academic and research projects.
- **Debugging and Reproducibility**: Helps users understand the data pipeline and aids in debugging or recreating analyses.
- **Collaborative Data Projects**: Allows team members to track and verify data transformations collaboratively.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies.
2. Import `pandas_provenance` and begin using provenance-tracked operations with ease in any data analysis project.
3. Save and examine the provenance log to see a step-by-step record of your data manipulations.

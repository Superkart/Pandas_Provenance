1. Project Title and Description
Title: Start with the name of the project (e.g., Pandas Provenance Tracker).
Description: A brief explanation of the project, what it does, and its main features.
2. Features
List the key features of the tool. This can include:
Automatic provenance logging for pandas operations.
Tuple-level granularity to track row-level changes.
Easy integration with pandas.
Support for reproducibility and accountability in data processing.
3. Installation Instructions
Provide clear steps to install the project. Example:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas-provenance-tracker
4. Usage
Give a basic example of how users can implement your tool in their own projects. Include code examples and explain how to use the provenance tracking features. Example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from pandas_provenance_tracker import filter_with_provenance

# Example of using provenance tracking
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'B': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
})

filtered_df = filter_with_provenance(df, 'A', lambda x: x > 2)
print(filtered_df)
5. System Architecture
Provide a high-level explanation of how your system is built:

Data Operations Module: Handles operations like filtering, merging.
Provenance Logger: Logs metadata such as operation type, time, affected rows.
Log Storage: Stores provenance data in structured formats (e.g., JSON).
If you have a diagram or flowchart, include it here to make the explanation easier to understand.

6. Applications
Explain where your project can be applied, such as in:

Research: For transparent and reproducible data workflows.
Data Auditing: For compliance and verification of data transformations.
Collaboration: Helps teams understand how data has evolved.
7. Challenges
Mention some of the challenges faced during development, such as:

Managing large datasets.
Ensuring tuple-level granularity without performance issues.
8. Contributing
Provide guidelines on how others can contribute to the project. Example steps:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch.
Make changes and commit.
Push to your branch and create a pull request.
9. License
Mention the projectâ€™s license (e.g., MIT License). If applicable, link to the LICENSE file.
